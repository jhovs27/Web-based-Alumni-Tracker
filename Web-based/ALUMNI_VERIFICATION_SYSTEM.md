# Alumni Verification System with Automatic Student Data Fetching

## Overview

This system automatically fetches and displays student information from the database when an alumni ID is entered during registration. The student information is displayed in read-only fields and cannot be modified by the user, ensuring data integrity.

## Database Structure

### Required Tables

1. **alumni_ids** - Contains alumni ID mappings
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `student_no` (Student Number)
   - `alumni_id` (Alumni ID in format YYYY-XXX)
   - `graduation_year`
   - `created_at`

2. **students** - Contains student personal information
   - `StudentNo` (Primary Key)
   - `LastName`
   - `FirstName`
   - `MiddleName`
   - `Sex`
   - `BirthDate`
   - `BirthPlace`
   - `ContactNo`
   - `email`
   - `Course`
   - And other fields...

3. **course** - Contains course information
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `course_title`
   - `accro`
   - And other fields...

4. **listgradmain** - Contains graduation main records
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `SchoolYear`
   - `DateOfGraduation`
   - And other fields...

5. **listgradsub** - Contains graduation sub-records
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `StudentNo`
   - `MainID` (Foreign Key to listgradmain)
   - And other fields...

## System Flow

### 1. Alumni ID Verification Process

When a user enters an alumni ID during registration:

1. **Input Validation**: Checks if the alumni ID format is correct (YYYY-XXX)
2. **Database Lookup**: Searches for the alumni ID in the `alumni_ids` table
3. **Student Data Fetching**: If found, retrieves the corresponding student number and fetches student information
4. **Data Display**: Shows the student information in read-only fields

### 2. Student Information Retrieved

The system automatically fetches and displays:

- **Last Name**
- **First Name** 
- **Middle Name** (or "No Initial Name")
- **Sex**
- **Birth Date**
- **Birth Place**
- **Contact Number**
- **Email**
- **Course**
- **Date of Graduation**
- **Academic Year Graduated**

### 3. Registration Process

1. User selects "Alumni" role
2. User enters Alumni ID (format: YYYY-XXX)
3. User clicks "Verify ID Number"
4. System validates and fetches student data
5. Student information is displayed in read-only fields
6. User completes registration with pre-filled data
7. System validates that the alumni ID hasn't been registered before

## Files Modified/Created

### 1. `verify_alumni_id.php` (Modified)

### 3. `test_student_fetch.php` (Created)
- Tests database connectivity and table structure
- Verifies data retrieval queries
- Shows sample data for debugging

### 4. `test_verification_process.php` (Created)
- End-to-end testing of the verification process
- Simulates the complete flow
- Displays formatted results

## Database Queries

### Main Student Data Query
```sql
SELECT 
    s.StudentNo,
    s.LastName,
    s.FirstName,
    s.MiddleName,
    s.Sex,
    s.BirthDate,
    s.BirthPlace,
    s.ContactNo,
    s.email,
    s.Course,
    c.course_title,
    lg.DateOfGraduation,
    lg.SchoolYear
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN course c ON s.Course = c.id
LEFT JOIN listgradsub lgs ON s.StudentNo = lgs.StudentNo
LEFT JOIN listgradmain lg ON lgs.MainID = lg.id
WHERE s.StudentNo = ?
```

## Security Features

1. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Uses prepared statements
3. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing registrations
4. **Data Integrity**: Read-only fields prevent unauthorized modifications

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Access the registration page
2. Select "Alumni" role
3. Enter a valid alumni ID (e.g., 2025-001)
4. Click "Verify ID Number"
5. Verify that student information is displayed
6. Complete registration process

### Automated Testing
Run the test files:
- `test_student_fetch.php` - Database connectivity and structure
- `test_verification_process.php` - End-to-end verification process

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:
- Invalid alumni ID format
- Non-existent alumni ID
- Missing student records
- Database connection errors
- Duplicate registrations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Email Verification**: Send verification emails to alumni
